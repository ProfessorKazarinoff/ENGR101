    "# Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "What you are looking at and reading right now is a _jupyter notebook_. A jupyter notebook is an electronic document like a Microsoft Word .docx document or an Adobe Acrobat .pdf document. Jupyter notebook file names end with the ```.ipynb``` file extension. ```.ipynb``` stands for _IPython Notebook_. Originally this type of notebook was called an _IPython Notebook_, but now they are called _jupyter notebooks_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks contain a combination of computer code, output and text. Jupyter notebooks can also contain plots, charts and images.  Jupyter notebooks run in web browser like google chrome or firefox. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Cells in a Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are composed of seperate _cells_. A cell contains text or code that is grouped together and runs as one block. Most Jupyter notebooks contain many cells. Each cell can be empty, one line long or contain many lines. There are three main types of jupyter notebook cells: code cells, output cells and markdown cells.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming code, in our case Python code, is typed into code cells. You can tell you are typing in a code cell becuase the is an ```In [ ]:``` to the left of the cell and the cell-type drop down menu shows **Code**. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Jupyter Notebook Code Cell](images/code_cell.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Code cells are run by clicking the <button class=\"btn btn-default\"><i class=\"fa-step-forward fa\"></i><span class=\"toolbar-btn-label\">Run</span></button> button on the top menu or pressing [Shift] + [Enter].\n",
    "\n",
    "![Jupyter Notebook Run Cell](images/run_cell.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "After a code cell is run, an output cell is often produced below it. The output cell contains the output from the code cell above it. Not all code produces output, so not all code cells produce output cells. The results of output cells can't be edited. If a code cell produces plots, charts or images, these outputs will be shown in output cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Jupyter Notebook Output Cell](images/output_cell.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can clear all the output cells and rerun code cells by selecting **Kernal -- > Restart Kernal and Clear All Outputs**.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Jupyter Notebook Clear All Outputs](images/kernel_restart_and_clear_output.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Markdown Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown cells don't contain code, they contain text.  Text in markdown cells that can be formatted to show **bold** or _italic_ text. Tables, images and lists can also be included in markdown cells. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Jupyter Notebook Markdown Cell](images/markdown_cell.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Text in markdown cells can be formatting using _markdown syntax_. An example of markdown syntax is putting an underscore before and after a word to cause the word to be formatted in itallics. The table below shows a couple examples of markdown syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "| markdown syntax | formatted result |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| ```_italics_``` | _italics_ |\n",
    "|```**bold**``` | **bold** |\n",
    "|```__**bold and italic**__``` | __**bold and italic**__ |\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown cells are run like code cells. The difference is that when markdown cells are run, the text is formatted (when code cells are run the code is excecuted). Markdown cells are run by clicking the <button class=\"btn btn-default\"><i class=\"fa-step-forward fa\"></i><span class=\"toolbar-btn-label\">Run</span></button> button on the top menu or pressing [Shift] + [Enter].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a new cell\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create a new cell in a Jupyter Notebook by clicking the [+] button in the upper menu. This will produce a new code cell below the current active cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Jupyter Notebook New Cell Button](images/new_cell_button.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also create a new cell using **Insert --> Cell** you can choose to insert a cell above or below the current active cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Changing the cell type\n",
    "\n",
    "The type of cell: code cell or markdown cell can be changed by clicking on a given cell and selecting the cell type from the dropdown menu\n",
    "\n",
    "[Jupyter Notebook Change Cell Type](images/change_cell_type.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Saving a Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks can be saved using the save icon in the upper menu or by pressing [Ctrl] + [s].\n",
    "\n",
    "![Jupyter Notebook Save](images/save_notebook.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks can also be saved as a copy, similar to the Save As command common in many programs. To save a copy of a jupyter notebook use **File --> Make a Copy...**\n",

    "## Renaming a Jupyter Notebook\n",

    "\n",
    "## Downloading a Jupyter Notebok\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks can be downloaded and saved using **File --> Download As --> Notebook (.ipynb)**. This will download the notebook as a .ipynb file. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Jupyter Notebook downloaded as .ipynb file](images/file_download_as_notebook.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when a .ipynb file is viewed in a text editor like notepad, the notebook is unformatted and looks like a confusing jumble of text. The notebook needs to be opened in a jupyter notebook file browser in order for it to be rendered.\n",
