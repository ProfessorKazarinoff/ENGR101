    "### What is Matplotlib?\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is a popular Python package used to plot data with Python. Matplotlib started as a project in the early 2000's partly as a way to use Python to visualize the electonic signals in the brains of epilepsy patients. Matplotlib's creator, Dr. John D. Hunter, was a neurobilogist. Dr. Hunter was looking for way to replicate MATLAB's plotting capability, but with Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to starting matplotlib, Dr. Hunter was part of the founding group that created Numfocus. Numfocus oversees some major Python projects including matplotlib, numpy, pandas and jupyter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use Matplotlib?\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is useful for creating static 2D plots, the kind of plots included in scientific publications and presentations. Almost any plot created in Microsoft Excel can be created with matplotlib. Matplotlib can also be used to make 3D plots and animations. Advanced topics like 3D plots and animations, will not be covered as part of this course.\n"
