    "When you download and install Python, you install the _Python Interpreter_. The Python interpreter is a program that runs on your computer. Other programs running on your computer include Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel and web browsers like Google Chrome or Firefox. Each of these prgrams use a different file type. The file type the Python Interpreter runs are files that contain Python code. You can think of the Python Interpreter like a cook that only does exactly what is listed in a recipie. Using this analogy, the recipie is kind of like Python code. Python code contains instructions that the Python Interpreter runs. "

    "## Brief History of Python\n",
    "Python was created by Guido van Rossum, a Dutch computer programmer, and was first released in 1991. The name _Python_ is attributed to _Monte Python_ the British commedy troupe that became popular in the 1970's and 80's for their TV show _Monte Python's Flying Circus_ and movies like _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_. Python 1.0 was released in 1994. Python 2.0 was released in 2000 that included additional features compared to the 1.0 version. In 2001 the Python Software foundation was formed to support legal, licencing, and fiscal arrangements that support the Python language. Python version 3.0 was released in 2008. The 3.x versions between 2008 are refered to as Python3 or modern Python. Versions in the 2.0 to 2.7 release of Python are considered legacy Python."

    "## Why was Python created?\n",
    "Guido created Python based on his experience working with another earlier computer programming language called ABC. Guido had a couple of \"gripes\" with the ABC programming language including it's lack of extensability. He wrote Python partly in response to this problem. Unlike ABC, Python is indeed very extensible. It can be extended with additional packages downloaded from the [PyPI.org](https://pypi.org) and runs on servers, desktop computers, laptops and tiny microcontrollers."
