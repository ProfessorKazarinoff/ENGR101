    "## Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "What you are looking at and reading right now is a _jupyter notebook_. A jupyter notebook is an electronic document like a Microsoft Word .docx document or an Adobe Acrobat .pdf document. Jupyter notebook file names end with the ```.ipynb``` file extension. ```.ipynb``` stands for _IPython Notebook_. Originally this type of notebook was called an _IPython Notebook_, but now they are called _jupyter notebooks_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks contain a combination of computer code, output and text. Jupyter notebooks can also contain plots, charts and images.  Jupyter notebooks run in web browser like google chrome or firefox. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Cells in a Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are composed of seperate _cells_. A cell contains text or code that is grouped together and runs as one block. Most Jupyter notebooks contain many cells. Each cell can be empty, one line long or contain many lines. There are three main types of jupyter notebook cells: code cells, output cells and markdown cells.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Code Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming code, in our case Python code, is typed into code cells. You can tell you are typing in a code cell becuase the is an ```In [ ]:``` to the left of the cell and the cell-type drop down menu shows **Code**. \n",

    "#### Output Cells\n",
    "\n",
    "After a code cell is run, an output cell is often produced below it. The output cell contains the output from the code cell above it. Not all code produces output, so not all code cells produce output cells. The results of output cells can't be edited. If a code cell produces plots, charts or images, these outputs will be shown in output cells. \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Markdown Cells\n",
